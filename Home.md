## 🚀 Getting Started

### New Wizards
1. Navigate to your personal [[Wizards/|Grimoire]]
2. Click **"Create New Week"** and enter a week number (e.g., **1**) to start your first week.
3. Complete the tasks and take notes
4. **Add all your questions** to the **"Discussion Points for Next Session"** section in your weekly Notes.md file
5. Share your learnings in [[Shared Docs/README|Shared Docs]]

> **📝 Why track questions in Discussion Points?**
>
> All questions you add to the "Discussion Points for Next Session" section in your weekly notes are **automatically aggregated** into the [[📚 Wizards MOC|Wizards Dashboard]] under "Prepare for Next Session."
>
> This means:
> - Your mentor can review **all wizards' questions in one place** before sessions
> - Questions are organized by wizard and week for easy reference
> - Your mentor comes prepared with better answers and examples
> - No question gets forgotten or lost in chat messages
>
> Don't wait for the mentoring session to ask, write questions down as you learn, and they'll automatically appear on your mentor's dashboard.
