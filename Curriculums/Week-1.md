# Tech 101

> **Learning tech isn’t really about tech—crazy, right?**

It’s actually about _learning how to learn._ That’s the real skill underneath everything else.

The syntax, tools, and frameworks will change a hundred times in your career. But your ability to adapt, stay curious, and keep moving forward that’s what lasts.

It's all about the process of learning itself, and that's my goal in this mentorship  to guide you through all the messy corners of tech.

### Reflection

Ever feel like you don’t quite belong in your role?  
Like you just got lucky landing the job, That you've somehow fooled people into thinking you're more capable than you are? or that at any moment someone might realize you have no idea what you’re doing?

That quiet little voice whispering _“you’re not supposed to be here” That’s the voice of the impostor syndrome.

> "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take." by Wayne Gretzky

**Key insight:** 0.001% > 0%  _imperfect action always beats perfect inaction._

Every time you take a shot, apply for the job, push the code, ask the question, you’re proving that voice wrong.

### What’s Really Going On

Impostor syndrome isn’t about actual skill. It’s about the feeling of not being enough, even when you are.

And in tech, that feeling thrives.
Why? Because the field moves at lightspeed. There’s always a new framework, tool, or buzzword you haven’t heard of yet. No one—literally no one—knows it all.

Add in social media’s highlight reels, “10x engineer” myths, and polished conference talks that make everything look easy—and suddenly, it’s easy to feel like you’re the only one still figuring things out.

**Spoiler:** You’re not. Everyone’s figuring things out. Some are just better at hiding it.

#### What is Impostor Syndrome?
- A psychological pattern where you doubt your accomplishments and have a persistent fear of being exposed as a "fraud"
- Despite external evidence of competence, you feel undeserving of success.
- It's not about actual incompetence, it's about the feeling of incompetence despite evidence to the contrary.

#### Why it's Prevalent in Tech
- It’s a rapidly evolving field. we’ve seen it happen over and over. The latest wave is AI, which has accelerated everything to lightspeed.
	- But remember: no one can know everything.
- Social media showcases highlight reels of others’ achievements without showing their struggles.
	- Most of the time, people either want to sell you something or feel good about themselves.
- Tech often celebrates "10x engineers" and prodigies, creating unrealistic benchmarks which makes normal growth feel like failure
- Developer advocates and polished demos make everything look effortless.
- Many of us come from self-taught backgrounds, which can fuel doubts about legitimacy.
- Modern software systems are incredibly complex. so complex that no single person understands them all (nor are they expected to).


## The Mindset Shift

Not knowing something doesn’t make you an impostor. **It makes you a learner**.

The learning curve **_is_** the job.  
Everyone has gaps, even the “experts.”  
Asking questions isn’t a weakness. it’s how real expertise begins.

Keep taking imperfect action. The people who grow fastest aren’t the ones who know everything but they’re the ones who keep showing up, even when they don’t.
